Thermistor Check Tool v1.0

This program is written in C++ and runs in the terminal/command prompt window.  
Provdided is all of the source files needed to build the program, and also a pre-compiled 
executable for macOS.

This tool creates an thermistor object in memory, which can then be used to calculate 
expected resistance readings from a given temperature, or temperature from a given 
resistance reading. This calculation is done using the B Parameter Equation and rounds the 
result to the nearest integer.

I designed and use this tool as an appliance repair aid for checking if a refrigerator 
thermistor is reading within acceptable range.
